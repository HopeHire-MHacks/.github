## What is HopeHire?
Introducing "HopeHire" - an online job search portal that uses the power of machine learning to help kidney patients find employment opportunities. Often overlooked in the job market due to the challenges and time constraints associated with their treatment, kidney patients face unique hurdles in their job search. 

That's where HopeHire comes in. By leveraging the capabilities of TensorFlow Recommenders, HopeHire dynamically recommends patients to potential employers and vice versa, taking into account specific attributes that only kidney patients possess, such as proximity to dialysis centers, medical schedule, and the amount of physical labor required at work. 

With HopeHire, kidney patients can find meaningful employment opportunities that suit their individual needs, empowering them to achieve their professional aspirations while managing their medical needs.
